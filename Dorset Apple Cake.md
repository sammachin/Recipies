225g butter, softened, plus extra for greasing
450g Bramley Apples
Finely grated zest and Juice of 1 lemon
225g caster sugar, plus extra for dredging
3 large Eggs
225g self-raising flour
2 tsp baking powder
Demerara sugar


Method
Preheat the oven to 160 C fan. Grease a 23-24cm cake tin with butter and line the base with a circle of baking paper. First, zest your lemon and set aside for later. Peel, core and cut the apples into pieces, and add the the lemon juice. Set aside.
Cream together the butter, caster sugar and lemon zest in a bowl until smooth and pale. Beat in the eggs, 1 at a time. After each egg, add about a tbsp of flour from your overall amount. Add the remaining flour and the baking powder into the bowl. Next, fold in the drained apples.
Pour into your cake tin, smooth over the top and sprinkle with the demerara sugar (you can get excited and go a bit over the top with this.) Bake until well-risen, brown and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Mine baked for 45 minutes but it can take up to 1 hour. Cover the cake with some baking paper if it starts to get too dark.
Leave to cool in the tin for a few minutes and then serve warm. You can also coat the top with more caster sugar if you want. Serve with ice cream, pouring cream or clotted cream.
