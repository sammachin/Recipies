For cooking in the Ooni Volt

Ingredients:
350g ap or bread flour
100g whole grain flour
50g whole spelt flour
315g water
12g sea salt
100 grams yeasted preferment
100 grams sourdough preferment
Pinch of yeast, optional
Fresh water mozz, shredded
Sauce + basil

Method:
1. Combine all ingredients into a stand mixer bowl with dough hook. Mix until the dough is smooth.
2. Let rest at room temperature for 3 hours.
3. Oil your Detroit pizza pan. For the large Ooni pan, I use about 630 grams of dough.
4. Let your dough sit in the pan, covered, for 1 hour at room temperature. Place into the fridge for 24 hours.
5. Remove from fridge and let come up to temp, about an hour.
6. Pull dough to the sides of the pan. Dimple and let rest another hour. Preheat your oven to 500f.
7. Par bake the dough for about 8-10 minutes, until dark brown and golden on the bottom.
8. Cover with shredded cheeses of your choice. Make sure to spread to the sides. Bake until the cheese solidifies and forms crispy edges on the sides. I like to let the cheese get a little charred on top.
9. Remove from the pan and cover with sauce. I like to go heavy with a thinner sauce. Finish with basil, parm, and olive oil if desired
